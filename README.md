🚀 C Practice Repository: Sharpening Skills & Cracking Code Challenges
🔥 Why This Exists
Programming is a puzzle, and C is the ultimate tool to solve it. This repository is my personal code dojo, where logic meets efficiency, and every bug is a step toward mastery. From refining string manipulation to diving deep into bitwise operations, it’s all about leveling up one function at a time.
📂 What’s Inside
🔹 Basics/ – Loops, conditionals, pointers—the building blocks.
🔹 String Manipulation/ – Clever tricks for text processing like swapcase, removeSpaces.
🔹 Bitwise Operations/ – Harnessing the power of binary for smarter computing.
🔹 Optimization/ – Making code faster and smarter with fewer resources.
🔹 Competitive Programming/ – Tackling IIT JAM & GATE coding challenges.
